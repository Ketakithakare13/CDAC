4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?

=> It is not possible to see the first five rows of a table because SQL tables don’t have a specific "order" by default. Rows are stored in the order the database finds efficient, not necessarily the order they were inserted. To see specific rows, you need to tell the database how to sort the data (e.g., using ORDER BY) and then limit the number of rows with LIMIT.
