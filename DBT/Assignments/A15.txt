                      Using Subqueries with DML Commands.

1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions 
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one 
customer into this table.
=>
mysql> CREATE TABLE MULTICUST AS SELECT * FROM SALESPEOPLE;
mysql> TRUNCATE MULTICUST;

mysql> INSERT INTO MULTICUST(SNUM, SNAME, CITY , COMM)
    -> SELECT SNUM, SNAME, CITY , COMM FROM SALESPEOPLE
    -> WHERE SNUM IN (SELECT SNUM FROM CUSTOMERS GROUP BY SNUM HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.05 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT * FROM MULTICUST;
+------+--------+--------+------+
| Snum | Sname  | City   | Comm |
+------+--------+--------+------+
| 1001 | Peel   | London | 0.12 |
| 1004 | Motika | London | 0.11 |
+------+--------+--------+------+

2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.
=>
mysql> DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
    -> WHERE CNUM NOT IN (SELECT CNUM FROM ORDERS);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
+------+----------+----------+--------+------+
| Cnum | Cname    | City     | Rating | Snum |
+------+----------+----------+--------+------+
| 2001 | Hoffman  | London   |    100 | 1001 |
| 2002 | Giovanni | Rome     |    300 | 1003 |
| 2003 | Liu      | San Jose |    200 | 1004 |
| 2004 | Grass    | Berlin   |    300 | 1004 |

3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all 
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.
=>
mysql> UPDATE SALESPEOPLE
    -> SET COMM  = COMM * 1.20
    -> WHERE SNUM IN (SELECT SNUM FROM ORDERS GROUP BY SNUM HAVING SUM(AMT) > 3000);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT * FROM SALESPEOPLE;
